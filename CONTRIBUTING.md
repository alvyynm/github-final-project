# Welcome to Interest Calc contributing guide

Here's how you can contribute to the project:

1. Fork the repository at https://github.com/alvyynm/interestcalc
2. Clone the origin to your local machine by running `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME-HERE/interestcalc` via HTTPS or `git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME-HERE/interestcalc.git` via SSH
3. Add your desired changes to the local copy of the project
4. Commit your changes and push the project to the origin repository
5. Make a pull request to the upstream repository

Once you've made a pull request, I will review the code and merge it into the project if everything looks good.
